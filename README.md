# Notes on the TypeScript Presentation
There is no need to install this example but if you want to install it run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

You can run the scripts in `package.json`. They are default `vite.js` commands.

```sh
npm run dev
or
npm run build
followed by
npm run preview
```

Primary purpose is to share notes in the `main.ts` file located in:


```sh
/src/main.ts
```
